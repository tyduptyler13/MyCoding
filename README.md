# MyCoding
Learning to program

How to use
==========
Welcome to MyCoding. This is a simple and easy tutorial suite for basic coding in
C++.

Recommended method
------------------
The best method to experience these programming excersizes is using the platform
c9. Create an account and reference this github project and it will automatically
clone it into your workspace. It also has all of the dependencies you should need
already installed by default. The default c9 editor is plenty powerful and the
terminal works great. You will still need to know how to navigate around using a
terminal. See CLI to continue.

Personal Method
---------------
In order to participate in the challenge you must have the following installed on
your computer.

* Some text editor or ide - Kate, Vim, Atom, Eclipse, and many others can suite
your needs but I hightly recommend using something easy and straight forward like
Atom. (We will be moving forward assuming you know how to use your editor or that
you are using Atom)
* g++ or clang - We are writing c++ but we also need to be able to compile it and
run it to test what our code does.
* make - This is a tool for easily executing commands from command line.
* git (recommended) - A tool for updating these files but you can just download
from github as a zip.
* [cli] bash or higher tool (zsh, etc) - This is the terminal you will be running
commands from (unless you use the gui)
* [gui] Node.js and npm - This is the platform designed to run our gui code. 
(A standalone version of the gui will be available that doesn't require either of
these but its not ready yet)

Note: Some other dependencies will be automatically built on their own.

CLI
---
The cli is very straight forward and will help in learning linux if you are new 
to it. The commands you need to know are simple. From your terminal change into 
the directory that contains this readme. Using `cd` and pressing tab will help 
you find the path.

Make sure you are in the right directory before moving forward. Typing `ls` you 
should see README.md listed among the results as well as directories in the format
lesson1, etc.

Now we will begin a lesson. Change your directory to lesson0 and read the README
file inside to continue.

##Commands

* `make` - generates a lessons executable, you can run it with `./lesson`
* `make test` - Tests your executable against simple test cases.
* `make grade` - Does the final test with hidden test cases and produces a score.
* `make clean` - Removes all generated files. 

GUI

Not yet available. Please use the CLI for now.


Lessons
=======
Learning from the ground up

Lesson0
-------
This lesson does not require any actual coding but will show you the basics of 
how these lessons will work.

Lesson1
-------
Hello world. You will learn to write a program that says hello and how to use 
STDIN and STDOUT.

Lesson2
-------
Learning for loops, some types, and simple conditions.

Lesson3
-------
Functions - Learning to create functions for doing things we will do repeatedly.

Lesson4
-------
Arrays - Learning how arrays can help with your tasks.

Lesson5
-------
Classes and the basics of object oriented programming.

Lesson6
-------
Pointers/References and the power of c++.

Lesson7
-------
Polymorphism


Intermediate Lessons
====================
More advanced concepts

Most of these challenges will require some exploring and lots of trial and error
to master.

Topics
------
* Multithreading
* Networking
* Asynchronous Programming
* Closures/Lambdas

__Coming soon__

Advanced Lessons
================
Learning advanced topics

These topics will require lots of external research (usually) and lots of trial
and error to even get working correctly.

* Map Reduce (Might be intermediate)
* Computer Graphics (Raytracing and OpenGL)

__Coming eventually__
